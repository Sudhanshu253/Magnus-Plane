# Magnus Plane
This project focuses on the design, development, and testing of a functional experimental aircraft based on the Magnus effect—an unconventional aerodynamic principle where lift is generated through the rotation of cylindrical surfaces instead of traditional wings.

## Project Highlights

- Designed and developed a working prototype using **Fusion 360**, with a focus on rotational lift mechanisms and aircraft stability.
- Planned detailed component layout, calculated structural dimensions, and analyzed **power and control system requirements** for optimal performance.
- Fabricated the airframe using **balsa wood, thermocol, carbon fiber rods**, and integrated key control elements like **servo motors**.
- Implemented a **dual-pulley belt system** to achieve controlled cylinder rotation, enabling Magnus-effect-based lift generation.
- Validated aerodynamic behavior using principles from the **Kutta–Joukowski theorem**, supporting the feasibility of non-traditional lift designs.

## Technologies & Tools

- Fusion 360 (CAD Design)
- Manual fabrication and prototyping
- RC electronics (servo motors, ESCs, Li-Po batteries)
- Aerodynamic theory and mechanical modeling

## Purpose

The project demonstrates the potential of **alternative lift mechanisms** in UAV design, especially for **low-speed, short-runway, or VTOL** applications where conventional airfoils may not be ideal.
